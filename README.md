This code represents one of my task from my Internship at Prodigy Infotech. 
It is a basic keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes. 
It Focus on logging the keys pressed and saving them to a text file.

KEYLOGGER - 
A keylogger, short for keystroke logger, is a type of surveillance technology used to monitor and record each keystroke typed on a specific computer's keyboard. 
Keyloggers can be hardware or software-based and are often used for malicious purposes, such as stealing passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive information. 
However, they can also be used for legitimate purposes, such as monitoring employee activity, troubleshooting technical problems, or ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.

**************** WORKING OF PROGRAM ****************
After excecuting this program, it starts recording the keystrokes.
So, whatever you type it will be recorded and save into a text file.
